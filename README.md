# Ball-CPE-Demo
A simple Unity demo showing how physics objects can be manipulated using [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) sensor data over a serial connection. Written during my PLA position for [IMGD 3200: Interactive Electronic Arts](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/calendar-courses/course-descriptions/3861/interactive-media-game-development#IMGD-3200) at WPI.
